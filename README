1. What is Merlin?
==================

Merlin is a wxWidgets-based application, designed for UNIX systems (e.g.
Linux, BSD, Mac OS X) which allows the user to see a visual representation
of data captured using a DiscFerret or CatWeasel magnetic disc analyser.

It provides three main visualisation functions:
  * Histogram. Displays the various timing periods used on the disc, and
    the relative frequency of their use.

  * SpeedGraph. Displays a plot of the disc data rate versus sample number.
    This diagram can be used to determine whether a disc was written as one
    continuous track, or (with sufficient timing data) if it was written
    by multiple different disc drives and/or controllers.

  * Scatter plot. This can be used to assess the quality of a disc image.
    An ideal image will show a narrow horizontal line for each histogram
    peak, with good separation between the peaks and little data in the
    "white space". This analysis function was added as a result of a "that
    looks darned useful!" moment inspired by the following article on
    techtravels.org:
      <http://techtravels.org/amiga/amigablog/?p=362>



2. How do I build Merlin?
=========================

You will need:
  - A working C++ compiler.
  - GNU Make.
  - The current wxWidgets 2.8 libraries and development headers.

If you want to edit the dialogue resources, a copy of DialogBlocks will be
extremely useful. This is a shareware application developed and published by
Anthemion Software; see <http://www.dialogblocks.com/> for more information.

Merlin is currently being developed with the following tools:
  - Ubuntu Linux 10.10 "Maverick Meerkat"
  - DialogBlocks 4.40
  - GNU GCC 4.4.5 (Ubuntu/Linaro)
  - GNU Make 3.81
  - wxWidgets 2.8.11

It should be possible to build Merlin 'verbatim' on any recent Linux
distribution (e.g. within the past 18 months or so). For Debian- and
Ubuntu-based distributions, the following Apt packages will be required to
build Merlin from source:

  - build-essential
  - libwxbase2.8-dev
  - libwxgtk2.8-dev

When you have all of these installed, decompress the Merlin distribution
tarball ('tar -zxf' or 'tar -jxf'), then 'cd' into the newly-created Merlin
directory and run 'make'. The Merlin executable will be placed in the current
directory, and will be called... "merlin"

Type "./merlin" at a terminal window (gtkterm, xterm, etc.) to run Merlin.


3. How do I use this thing?

  1. Load an image file.
     This is done via the File -> Open menu; you will need to select the
     appropriate file format from the list presented.

  2. Select a disc track to analyse.
     Assuming the file loaded correctly (Merlin will tell you if it didn't),
     you will need to select a disc track from the list on the left side of
     the Merlin window.
     The format for entries in this list is:
       <track>:<side>/<sector> [<X> samples]

     track:  Disc physical track number. If you have a 40-track image, this
             will range from 0 to 39. For an 80-track image, it will range
             from 0 to 79... you get the idea.

     side:   Physical side (head) number. Head 0 is usually written to first,
             then Head 1, and so on (if there are any other heads). Some disc
             formats may do this differently.

     sector: Disc sector number. This will only be shown for hard-sectored
             disc images. Sector 1 is the first sector after the track mark.

     X:      Number of timing samples recorded by the analyser. This can be
             anywhere from around 40,000 (Catweasel image of a 5.25in DD disc
             at 28MHz) to 520,000 or more (DiscFerret image of a very long
             track, e.g. Nintendo Famicom Disc System).

Please feel free to report bugs, submit patches, or make feature requests. The
TODO file contains a list of features which are currently awaiting
implementation.

The wxFreeChart charting library was developed by Moskvichev Andrey V., then
later expanded and improved upon by Mike Sazonov and Andreas Kuechler.
